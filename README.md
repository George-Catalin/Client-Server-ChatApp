#Client-Server-ChatApp
A Chat application is realized for the Client and the Server which is biased on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) where TCP is the connection oriented protocol and is reliable. After starting a server on a specific port, users can establish a connection to it through a friendly Graphical User Interface mentioning the port and the IP address of the creator. The first user connected to the chat becomes the coordinator of that chat and is put in charge of maintaining the conversation and pinging the state of the group to all other members. On log out the title is lost and is inherited by other users.
